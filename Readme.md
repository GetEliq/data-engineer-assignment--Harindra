# Energy Consumption Data Platform

The system ingests parquet data, engineers features, stores results in SQLite, and runs SQL-based analytics for insights.

Features Generated

- **Time features** (hour, day-of-week, weekend, month, year): capture temporal usage patterns.  
- **Lag features** (1h, 24h): measure short-term consumption memory.  
- **Rolling stats** (24h mean/std): smooth fluctuations and identify abnormal spikes.  
- **Daily aggregates** (total, mean, peak hour, peak kWh): summarize load profiles.  
- **Rolling 7d/30d averages**: detect weekly/monthly trends.  
- **Consumption categories** (very low â†’ high): classify usage intensity.  
- **Seasonality & holidays**: flag winter/summer effects, public holidays, and vacation months.  
- **Monthly aggregates**: monitor long-term consumption patterns.  

These features provide a holistic view of consumer behavior, allowing for:  
- Peak demand detection  
- Seasonal trend analysis  
- Impact of holidays/vacations  
- Customer segmentation by consumption profile
